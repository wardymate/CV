A P2P social network for hosting and attending dinner parties. The idea was for users to meet and cook with/for local strangers. We provided a way for users to view events locally on a map or in a list. Sign up with an email address or Facebook. Create and edit events with the ability to add images. Join events and see who else is attending the event and receive booking confirmation.

**Yogabasebrighton**  
An informational site with blog posts about a group of Yoga teachers in Brighton. The group required a simple site that they could update with blog posts and link to their instagram account. I offered to build the site with no previous experience of web development and built using a simple CMS giving the group all their required functionality and designed to the clients request.
